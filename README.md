# Detect_Heart_Disease_using_patient_data
Detect_Heart_Disease_using_patient_data is a Flask-based ML app that predicts heart disease risk from patient inputs like age, BP, cholesterol, etc. It uses a trained model and scaler to process data, then returns predictions via a simple web form. Designed for demo/learning, not for medical diagnosis.          Ask ChatGPT

##  Features
- Simple web form accepts patient data like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.
- Uses a trained ML model and scaler to predict heart disease risk.
- Flask backend processes inputs and returns real-time outputs.
- Clear disclaimer: not intended for clinical use.

---

##  Dataset & Inputs
Typical input features include:
- Age
- Resting Blood Pressure (BP)
- Serum Cholesterol
- Thalach (Max Heart Rate)
- Others like Fasting BS, ECG results, etc.

(Ensure your training and form inputs match these.)

##  Setup & Installation
git clone https://github.com/Adityawagh786/Detect_Heart_Disease_using_patient_data.git
cd Detect_Heart_Disease_using_patient_data
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Flask, scikit-learn, etc.

Running the App:
python app.py
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the form.

---

Usage:<br>
1> Fill in the patient's details in the form.<br>
2> Submit â€” the app returns a prediction on heart disease risk.<br>
3> Use results for learning or model testing only.<br>

---

Future Improvements:<br>
*Enhanced UI with styled forms or dropdowns<br>
*Model upgrades: Tune hyperparameters or try ensemble models<br>
*Additional features: Add user authentication, logging, demo datasets<br>
*Validation: Add input checks and error handling<br>
